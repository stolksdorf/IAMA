<h1>Questioning Media</h1>
<p>The state of modern representation has glorified success and shorthanded attention spans. 
Pop culture tells us to dream, then fails to give us the answers when we begin reaching for that dream.
In the state of pop culture media, the truth is lost.

<i>Young people have questions, and we search for the answers</i></p>

<h2>Answers</h2>
<p>By reaching for the stories in these individual's aprts, we can directly see not noly the situations that had come across in thier lives, but how they dealt with them. As we slowly rebuild the definition of role model, we attempt to pirece through the facade, and find the moments of clarity in their individual character and experience. Our goal is to find raw answers, and we expect you to hold us accountable to the integrity of purpose. </p>

<h2>Interviews</h2>
